## Homework Assignment
In order to look at self reflection and to judge your assessment of information, you should solve the programming exercise below.

However - the important thing in this exercise is how you solved it, not the end result.

At the end of the programming exercise you should have:

* A list of all search queries you made to solve it, and timestamps (just copy it from the browser history)
* A list all pages you visited to solve it (just copy it from the browser history)
* A list of the 3 biggest stumbling blocks you came across and your reflection on why they were problematic (did you misunderstand something, was some of the info you found wrong, did you miss a detail, â€¦)
* A brief "every 30 min" diary as explained in the slides (this is more frequent than one would normally do, and is just meant as part of the exercise)
